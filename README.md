How to run the code:

For the GP model it is necessary to run the GP_vpd_preprocess.ipynb before running the GP_vpd.ipynb notebook. The preprocessing file will create the necessary data files that will be used to train and test the GP model.

The data needed for to run the linear and random forest models can be found in the data folder of this Github, or by using the vpd_preprocess.ipynb notebook if you have access to NCAR. The data must be placed into a folder in your working directory titled vpd_data.
